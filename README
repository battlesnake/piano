Script to start a TiMidity++ synth or fluidsynth and connect my MIDI controller (Evolution MK-449C) to it.

Be sure to edit the script head to match your keyboard/controller (the name of which can be found via `aconnect -o`).

By default, this uses Fluidsynth with the "Piano24" soundfont which can be obtained via a quick google search.  Edit the script to set `FLUIDSYNTH=0` to use TiMidity++ instead.

Syntax:
    piano
    piano start
    piano stop
    piano restart

With no parameters, "start" is assumed.

REMEMBER: Edit the script head to match your controller (`aconnect -o`).
